Universitas4
============

Try to check wether Armstrong CMS will be a good fit for Universitas.

Setup
-----

1. Create a virtualenv (optional):

        $ virtualenv univ4env
        $ source univ4env/bin/activate

2. Install dependencies:

        $ pip install -r requirements/project.txt

    You might need to either install some jpeg-dev packages, or just hotlink
    your system python-pil / python-pillow to your virtualenv.

3. Run project:

        $ armstrong runserver 0.0.0.0:5000
 
Hopefully it'll run. You might have to go to http://127.0.0.1/admin and add a
few entries. To create a new superuser, you can do:

    $ armstrong createsuperuser

License
-------

Currently too small for a license. But probably MIT, GPL or something like
that.
